  title: About II Open Xacobeo
  p1: The Second Xacobeo Disc Golf Open will be held during Holy Week 2022, between <strong>15 and 17 April</strong>, in <strong>Santiago de Compostela</strong>, a monumental city in Galicia whose old town is a World Heritage Site and attracts visitors and pilgrims from all over the world.
  p2: Although the most popular form of access is on foot, the city has good road access and an airport 14 kms from the centre and only 7 kms from Monte Do Gozo, where the disc golf course is located.
  p3: We hope this second edition will be as successful as the previous one, and are confident that the tweaks to the course design will make it even more challenging.
